# Python_MCP_Server
 In this tutorial, you’ll install MCP, explore its client-server architecture, and work with its core concepts: prompts, resources, and tools. You’ll then build and test a Python MCP server that queries e-commerce data and integrate it with an AI agent in Cursor to see real tool calls in action.
