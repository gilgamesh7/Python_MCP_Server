The Three Elven Rings—Vilya (Air), Nenya (Water), and Narya (Fire)—were powerful artifacts forged by Celebrimbor in Middle-earth, designed to preserve beauty, halt decay, and inspire courage, separate from Sauron's influence but bound to the One Ring's fate. Worn by Elrond (Vilya), Galadriel (Nenya), and Gandalf (Narya), they granted powers like healing, concealment, and inspiration, losing their potency when the One Ring was destroyed, allowing their bearers to depart Middle-earth.  
The Three Rings and Their Keepers
Vilya (Ring of Air): The mightiest of the three, made of gold with a blue stone, originally held by Gil-galad, then given to Elrond to protect Rivendell. 
Nenya (Ring of Water): A silver ring with a diamond, held by Galadriel, protecting Lothlórien. 
Narya (Ring of Fire): A ruby ring, held by Círdan, then given to Gandalf to inspire hope and courage. 
Key Characteristics & Powers
Preservation: Their primary power was to preserve, delaying time's weariness and guarding against decay. 
Invisibility: The Three could make their wearers invisible, unlike the One Ring which made its wearer invisible. 
No Direct Sauron Influence: Celebrimbor crafted them alone, but they were still linked to the One Ring, losing power when it was destroyed. 
Their Fate
When the One Ring was destroyed, the Three Rings lost their power, leading to the fading of Elven realms.
Galadriel, Elrond, and Gandalf, the last bearers, departed Middle-earth for the Undying Lands
